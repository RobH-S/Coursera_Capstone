There is also significant economic cost as a consequence of these incidents. \n\nAccording to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/costs/index.html), the cost of medical care and productivity losses associated with occupant injuries and deaths from motor vehicle traffic crashes exceeded $75 billion in 2017.\nDespite the significant impact of road collisions, travel is a critical part of life. Therefore it is important to understand the causes of and contributors to road collisions in order to develop effective strategies and policies for reducing these incidents, as well as the human and economic consequences.\n\n\nFor this project, the focus is on the City of Seattle, in the state of Washington on the North West cost of the United States of America."

However, quantifying and better understanding these will be critical to developing effective strategies and policies to reduce them.\n\nThe objective of this study is to build a robust, statistical model to identify the factors that predict which accidents result in injuries and death compares to those that do not (or result only in property damage).\n\nBy developing an understanding of the historical factors contributing to road collisions resulting in injury or death in the city of Seattle, this analysis can then be used by the Authorities to develop appropriate strategies and policies to reduce these outcomes.\n\nThis will be achieved through a statistical analysis of data collected on road collisions in order to identify the leading causes and contributing factors of road collisions that result in injuries or death."
